Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1
It the usest works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
It uses HPACK for data compression.

    age:23,
    salary:40,
    gender:"male"
};

var obj={
    name:"venkatesh",
    age:23,
